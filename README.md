# üê¢ GitHub Codespaces theme for oh-my-posh
I created this theme for oh-my-posh, because I really liked how the shell looks in github codespaces. This theme doesn't require nerd fonts to use. The second version uses ANSI colors only, to better fit with any theme.

## Installation
To install the theme, head over to the [oh-my-posh docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize) page, and follow the instructions!
